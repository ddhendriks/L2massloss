# L2massloss
This repository describes a model that determines the L2 mass loss fraction for binary mass transfer at very high rates

The main input parameters of the model are: donor mass, accretor mass, mass transfer rate, orbital separation; and the outputs are: L2 mass-loss fraction, vertical thickness of the accretion disk, advective and radiative cooling rates of the outer disk.
